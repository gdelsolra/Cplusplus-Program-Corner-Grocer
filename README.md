# Cplusplus-Program-Corner-Grocer

# Program description and challenges.

The project involved creating an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer to analyze daily purchase records and see how often items are bought.
This helps the store arrange items better for customers. The code was well-organized and clear. Using a class made the code neat and easy to maintain. 
The menu-driven interface was user-friendly, and adding comments and descriptive variable names made the code easy to understand.

The code could be improved by using more efficient data structures, which would make the program run faster, and by breaking functions into smaller parts,
making the code easier to test and maintain.

The most challenging part was handling file input and output correctly. To overcome this, I read C++ file I/O documentation, used debugging tools, and referred 
to online tutorials and forums. This project helped me develop skills that are useful for other projects, like designing classes, handling file operations, creating user 
interfaces, debugging, and writing clear code.

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I organized the code into a class with specific methods, added comments to explain key parts, used clear and 
descriptive names for variables and functions, followed consistent formatting and style guidelines, and provided detailed documentation of the codeâ€™s design and 
functionality. These practices made the code easier to understand and modify.
