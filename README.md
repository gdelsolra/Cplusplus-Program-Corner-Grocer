# Project Three: Grocery Tracking Program for Corner Grocer

The Grocery Tracking Program helps the Corner Grocer analyze daily sales records and optimize their produce layout. 
It processes a text file of purchased items and offers several useful features.


# Functionality:

The program allows users to search for the frequency of a specific item. By entering an item name, users can see how many times that item was purchased.
It displays a comprehensive list of all items along with their purchase frequencies. This helps the store understand which items are most and least popular.
The program provides a visual representation of item frequencies in the form of a histogram. Each item is displayed with asterisks, where the number of 
asterisks matches the item's purchase frequency.

At startup, the program reads the input file and creates a backup file named frequency.dat. This file includes all item frequencies for data recovery purposes.
The program features an easy-to-use menu that allows users to navigate between different functionalities. It includes input validation to ensure users 
enter valid choices and item names, preventing errors and enhancing reliability.

By leveraging this program, the Corner Grocer can gain valuable insights into their sales data, allowing them to better organize their produce section based 
on customer purchasing habits. This can lead to a more efficient store layout, improved customer satisfaction, and potentially increased sales.


# Potencial improvement

The code could be improved by using more efficient data structures, which would make the program run faster, and by breaking functions into smaller parts,
making the code easier to test and maintain.


# Project Challenges

The most challenging part was handling file input and output correctly. To overcome this, I read C++ file I/O documentation, used debugging tools, and referred 
to online tutorials and forums. This project helped me develop skills that are useful for other projects, like designing classes, handling file operations, creating user 
interfaces, debugging, and writing clear code.


# Adaptability, Maintainability, and Readability

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I organized the code into a class with specific methods, added comments to explain key parts, used clear and 
descriptive names for variables and functions, followed consistent formatting and style guidelines, and provided detailed documentation of the codeâ€™s design and 
functionality. These practices made the code easier to understand and modify.
